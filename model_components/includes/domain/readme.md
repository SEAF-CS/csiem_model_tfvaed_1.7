## Cockburn Sound model : model domain includes instruction files

<br>
Configuration instructions for model mesh and node-string of TUFLOW-FV simulation.

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

- domain_config_csiem_mesh\_{A/B/C}.fvc: configurations for hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, include 3 resolution options (A: fast model with coarse mesh; B: optimized mesh; C: high resolution)
- domain_config_csiem_mesh\_{A/B/C}\_budgeting.fvc: similar to above except include node-strings for nutrient budgeting
